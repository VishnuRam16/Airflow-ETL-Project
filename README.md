**Project Overview**

I've created an impressive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project using the following technologies:

- **Apache Airflow**: An open-source workflow orchestration platform used to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor data pipelines.
- **Docker**: A containerization platform that allows me to package my application and its dependencies into a single, portable container.
- **PostgreSQL**: An open-source relational database management system used as the destination for the data I'm extracting and transforming.
- **API**: I've utilized API calls to fetch data on Amazon's data engineering books, which serves as the source data for my ETL process.

The key steps in my project are:

1. **Data Extraction**: I'm using API calls to fetch data on Amazon's data engineering books. This represents the "Extract" step of the ETL process.

2. **Data Transformation**: Once the data is extracted, I'm using SQL to clean the data by removing any trailing data and converting the data types to the appropriate format. This is the "Transform" step.

3. **Data Loading**: The transformed data is then loaded into a PostgreSQL database, which represents the "Load" step.

4. **Orchestration with Apache Airflow**: I'm using Apache Airflow to orchestrate the entire ETL process, allowing me to schedule, monitor, and manage the data pipeline.

5. **Docker Containerization**: To ensure consistency and ease of deployment, I'm running the entire project within a Docker container.

This comprehensive ETL solution allows me to regularly and reliably fetch data from the Amazon API, transform it, and load it into a PostgreSQL database for further analysis or reporting.

# Amazon Data Engineering Books ETL

This project is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that fetches data on Amazon's data engineering books, transforms the data, and loads it into a PostgreSQL database.

## Technologies Used

- **Apache Airflow**: Used to orchestrate the data pipeline.
- **Docker**: Used to containerize the entire application and its dependencies.
- **PostgreSQL**: The destination database for the transformed data.
- **Python**: The programming language used for the data extraction and transformation logic.

## Features

- Fetches data on data engineering books from the Amazon API.
- Transforms the data by removing any trailing data and converting data types to the appropriate format.
- Loads the transformed data into a PostgreSQL database.
- Uses Apache Airflow to schedule, monitor, and manage the ETL process.
- Runs the entire application within a Docker container for easy deployment and consistency.

## Future Improvements

- Implement error handling and retries for the API calls.
- Add data quality checks and monitoring.
- Explore incremental data loading for improved performance.
- Investigate the use of a cloud-based data warehouse instead of a local PostgreSQL database.
